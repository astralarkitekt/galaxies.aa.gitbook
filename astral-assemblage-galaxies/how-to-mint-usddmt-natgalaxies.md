# How to Mint $DMT-NATGalaxies

We've designed these galaxies to be accessible at all levels.&#x20;

We've chosen to issue a limited supply using Digital Matter Theory Element Registration to control the supply. These tokens are called...

## How to Mint $DMT-NATGalaxies (Protogennema Universe)

$DMT-NATGalaxies are an open, free, first-come, first-serve mint with a supply of 124,992 as dictated by the "Alpha Omega" Pattern (alphaomega.a0.11.element).&#x20;

The Protogennema Universe was destroyed eons ago by The Urge in a fit of Jealous Rage. The remaining 777 galaxies supporting life will arguably be the hub of activity within the Protogennema Universe. These galaxies still containing life will be the FIRST 777 minted, and again - minting is first come first serve.

For those that mint a NATGalaxy AFTER the first 777 have been claimed, fear not, there are still mysteries to explore, artifacts to discover, and adventure to be had as you explore what once was. Our hope is that these now life-less galaxies will bloom anew when you choose to take up the mantle of Builder and create your own, immersive, interactive cosmic experience.

You can find a list of all valid mint scripts as of 7/7/2024 here:

Do not blindly copy and inscribe. While only 550+ $DMT-NATGalaxies have been claimed as of this writing, I don't want you to lose funds on a previously claimed block of galaxies.

Use [Geniidata Ordinals](https://geniidata.com/ordinals/home?ref=2LGEQK) search, and type the block height in double quotes that matches the galaxy you'd like to claim, like this: "133090"

Scan the resulting inscriptions (if any) for the word "natgalaxies"... If found, that means someone has already claimed that block height.

While you can mint anywhere, we hope you'll mint with us when that service is available, as the small service fee helps offset our development and inscription costs.
