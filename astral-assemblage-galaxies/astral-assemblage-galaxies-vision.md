# Astral Assemblage Galaxies Vision

Welcome to Astral Assemblage Galaxies, where we are pioneering a new frontier in cosmic exploration. Our goal is to create a dynamic and engaging multiverse that pushes the boundaries of what is possible when you combine on-chain generative art experiences with immersive gameplay and story-telling.

**Vision Statement**&#x20;

Our vision is to create a multiverse that acts as the intergalactic map for exploring the Universes of the Astral Assemblage. These galactic maps should be detailed down to the planetary level, explorable at the interstellar and system levels, and gamified to provide interactive, immersive, and memorable experiences. We aim to offer users opportunities for story, adventure, mystery, and exploration.

For builders who want to use these Galaxies for their own projects, this content should be binary in the sense that it's either on or off. If you, as a builder, wish to deactivate Astral Assemblage content and work with the raw galaxy devoid of storyline, lore, and gamification, you may do so from inside the inscription itself. This will allow you to generate a new configurable inscription that enables you to perform actions like deactivating AA Games content, indicating the mineable resources through recursion, and populating the galaxy through the inclusion of recursive datasets.

For Bitmap holders, whether you're a builder or not, the galaxies are intended to serve as Drop-In content for a Bitmap Parcel, with an inscription generator built into the inscription that allows you to do this.

As an owner of these Galaxies, you should be able to enjoy them by directly visiting and inviting others to visit and play within your galaxy. These additional players not only earn rewards within the Astral Assemblage Games Multiverse, but as the owner of the galaxy, you too will earn rewards that allow you to generate revenue from your galaxy by way of tradeable resources, characters, and artifact rewards.
