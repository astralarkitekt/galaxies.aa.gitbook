## Come Find Your Home in Our Stars

Dive into an interactive, gamified _multiverse_ where you can **play, explore, build and **_**thrive**_**.** Embark on epic journeys spanning thousands of unique galaxies.

### Play

Engage in story-driven adventures and uncover cosmic mysteries. Astral Assemblage Galaxies include content from the Astral Assemblage Games multiverse. Discover an epic saga unfolding as you make your way from star system to star system, engage in intense battles with the vile VOID Creatures, Gods, Demons, Monsters and more! Compete in high-score tournaments, Discover powerful cosmic artifacts, and awaken new heroes to join in the fight to Liberate the Stars.

### Explore

Navigate a multiverse of detailed 3D Galaxies detailed down to the planetary level! Using the latest techniques in non-arbitrary trait expression, some inventive algorithms and a healthy dose of Cosmic Lore, there's virtually no end to the stars, anomalies, and artifacts you can uncover!

### Bitmap Drop-In Content

HODLing Bitmaps, but not sure what to do with them? Drop an Astral Assemblage Galaxy on it! You don't have to be a builder to host immersive, interactive, engaging experiences on your District's Parcels. Astral Assemblage Galaxies will provide an inscription tool that generates the code necessary to put a Galaxy on one of your Bitmap Parcels. Invite others to come play, explore, excavate artifacts, collect resources, and awaken new heroes in the quest to Liberate your stars!

### Customizable & Composable

Want to build your own cosmic playground? Our goal is to provide Builders with the tools to enable you to "turn off" Astral Assemblage Games content and the programmatic access for you to add your own content, props, and games using javascript/html/css and some three.js magic. Inscribe this content on a bitmap parcel and enjoy!

### Hordes of Rewards

Earn and trade resources, artifacts, and playable characters, introducing the possibility of revenue as a galaxy owner.

## Two Universes, Two Tokens

The Astral Assemblage multiverse has a long and storied history spanning two very distinct Universes...&#x20;

### Protogennema - The Old Universe

The Old Universe - not unlike the one in which we find ourselves now - is an abandoned place, left behind to die by it's Flawed Father, The Urge. Today, while largely devoid of life, some civilizations do survive and thrive in the Old World. The Old World - a place once filled with Gods, Demons, Monsters, Fair Folk and Spirits alike still buzzes with mystery, adventure and excitement.&#x20;

While only 777 of the 124,992 galaxies in the Old World Universe still contain living, evolving civilizations - all of the galaxies within contain artifacts of past civilizations, resources to fuel your fight against the creatures from the VOID, and entire histories of mysteries to explore.

### The Hypostasis - The Material World Universe

The Material World Universe as ruled by the Hypostasis - An intergalactic consortium of Beings - Archons -  with the powers of Demi-Gods that rule over colonized space - is the Grand Cosmic Experiment playing out at the foot of the Throne of Substance. However, the Throne now sits vacant, The Urge having taken his leave of the Material World to Realms unknown some millennia before the cosmic calamity of the VOID Creature Incursion.

Encompassing the entire Bitcoin Blockchain, each Galaxy is bursting with Life, Mystery and Action! These interactive, 3D, interstellar cartographic maps are explorable at the Star System Level, Gamified, Customizable and Composable.&#x20;
